Below you can find my thoughts, organized into discrete posts, on various subjects. Since this is the first website I've ever managed, you'll probably notice some fuckery over the next few months as I get things sorted out. This includes gathering up all the scraps of writing that I've hidden underneath various rocks across the internet and migrating them here, to their (hopefully) permanent residence. 

Fortunately for both of us, if you don't have the patience for that sort of thing, neither of us actually has to deal with it. I'll probably never include a comments section, but I'm pretty likely to read anything I'm sent via email. To earn an immediate block, send me an email demanding that I include a comments section.
