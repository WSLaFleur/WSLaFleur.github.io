Hi, I'm Wes and - unless something has gone very wrong - you probably haven't heard of me. I spend my time [making art](https://www.deviantart.com/westlylafleur) and [music](https://soundcloud.com/westlylafleur), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69898047-westly-scott-lafleur), writing and learning new skills. I also play a lot of video-games, which I occasionally [stream to Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wslafleur).

While it's always somewhat uncomfortable reducing your entire personhood to a blurb, there are a few things I feel pretty confident putting forward. First of all, I am a lifelong learner, a rationalist (of the [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) variety), and a proponent of individual sovereignty. Regarding almost all of the controversial issues of our times: I think that the truth is often messy, difficult to understand and, once understood, utterly boring.
