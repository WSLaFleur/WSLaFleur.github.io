## Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong
- 4-stars
This book is going to ruffle a lot of feathers because it's got clear progressive political leanings. As a nonpartisan reader, I found Loewen to be reasonably even-handed. His major axe to grind is one that I sympathize with: History - as a subject matter in the United States - has had the controversy leeched out of it, and its desiccated remains are justifiably repugnant to contemporary students. The result is an entire generation or more of United States citizens whose feelings range from disinterest to resentment over the subject of their country's history.

I've become skeptical of all authoritative historical claims lately, but Loewen goes to great lengths to qualify his own expertise and opinions, which - in my opinion - should put you somewhat at ease. If nothing else, I can strongly recommend this book as a call to action to rectify an injustice wrought upon our educational system in America, which badly needs an overhaul in any case.

Aside from the feeling that the author harps on a little much in the direction of progressivist rhetoric, I enjoyed this book without caveat.

## Magician: Apprentice (The Riftwar Saga, 1)
- 3-stars
** spoiler alert ** So far, it's been pretty middling. It's definitely not bad, there are the threads of a world that I could be interested in here, but it really hasn't landed throughout the whole book. According to the foreword, this was his first novel and, in my opinion, it definitely shows. On a granular level the writing is tangibly amateurish and, in terms of narrative, there's a whole lot happening but I never quite felt hooked.

Setting aside my issues with the technical aspects of the writing, my biggest gripe is that none of these characters really feels 'fleshed out' by the end of the book. We're obviously supposed to care about Pug, who appears to be our protagonist, but he sorta disappears in the fourth quarter of the book and this isn't resolved by the end. I definitely care more about Tomas, Martin and Arutha (who is probably my favorite character at the moment), but any of these characters could get taken out and I doubt I'd really feel the impact. In my opinion, this is a pretty big problem - I don't actually feel invested in any of the characters. Carline is a glaring example of the author's failure to develop characters; she starts out as a spoiled brat and never shows any signs of being anything else, although we are repeatedly told that she's 'more than she seems' and then, later on, she develops out of the blue heroic abilities that don't feel really feel earned. Her entire personality does a flip-flop and all we really get to see is a single session of fencing between her and Roland.

Anyway, it probably seems like I'm really hammering it here when I honestly feel like it's an 'alright' fantasy novel. There are several charming interactions between characters interspersed throughout the book. It's very obviously the first book in a series, and I'm willing to bet that the author gets better. The world is, if not enthralling, definitely interesting. I may choose to pursue the 2nd book at some point.

There are a lot of loose threads that never get wrapped up, which is fine for a book series, but it honestly doesn't end on a feeling of resolution or suspense. It just sort of ends. So, for anybody else who might be thinking about picking this one up, know that once you're in, you'll probably be in for at least two books before you get any serious payoff and I can't guarantee even that yet.

## Equal Rites (Discworld, 3; Witches, 1)
- 5-stars
I've been trundling through the Discworld novels in sequence and enjoying them well enough, but this is the first one where - rather than fighting off the occasional spat of mirth - I found myself, as a reader, settling into a much deeper satisfaction. I'm working my way through the next book already and it seems pretty clear to me that things are coming together in Discworld; the universe is beginning to feel less like an excuse for Pratchett to exercise cheeky humor and browbeat the reader with well-timed punchlines and more like a substantial fictional realm with a hard-earned personality.

This book follows Eskarina, the disc's first female wizard, and the challenges that she faces in running against magical tradition. I'm the sort of reader who is pretty easily bothered by really overt sociological parallels when there's an axe to grind, but you'll find no such axe here - just good natured, well-written fantasy peppered with a powerful sense of irony.

Eskarina and granny, her mentor figure, are two of the most (for lack of a better word here) lovable characters I've ever had the pleasure of following.

## Ishmael (Ishmael, 1)
- 5-stars
Daniel Quinn's Ishmael is, unapologetically, a book with something to teach you. The narration is first person, told by a student of Ishmael, and consists primarily of a back-and-forth discussion between them. There are times when this feel painfully pejorative, especially moments when the narrator being particularly slow to grasp something that Ishmael is trying to explain. The narrator is not always slow, so this occasional stupidity is obviously an excuse for Ishmael to expound upon the subject; thankfully, Ishmael is almost always there to rescue the reader by browbeating his dullard pupil, but this only goes so far in saving face. The overall effect is that the argument feels somewhat reduced by the presence of an obvious strawman. On the other hand, it seems like part of the intended message to point out that our current way of life (as a global society) is necessarily held together by thoughtless denial.

Ishmael is a hard-edged environmentalist, who sees post-agricultural human society as inherently flawed. The dialogue remains deliberately vague — in an effort to evade the typical snares that plague environmental debate — and plunges deeper, raining down hammer blows against the avaricious anthropocentrism of modern society. At a glance, it would be easy to dismiss this book as alarmist, regressive hippy nonsense. I think that would be a mistake, though. The way Ishmael is written, it takes great pains to avoid being pinned down to any of the tired clichés; this is explicitly not about hunter-gathering versus agriculture, for instance. Fortunately, that makes the whole experience vey thought-provoking. Unfortunately, it also leaves the reader with the distinctive aftertaste of doublethink.

We are a part of the natural order, but with the additional burden of metacognition. As a species, we're headed for extinction but we can self-correct. The book seems to suggest that we ought not think of ourselves as outside of the natural order, but privileges us as potential shepherds at a critical juncture in evolutionary history. It does not make concrete suggestions as to how we should feel about natural selection.

If you like thinking hard about problems that are well beyond the scope of an individual human being, you'll appreciate this book.

## Ender's Game (Ender's Saga, 1)
- 4-stars
If you're a member of the self-fulfilling prophecies club (i.e. gifted and talented as a child), then this book will shoot you straight back to your childhood inferiority complexes as though you were fired from a cannon.

I've seen a bit of praise for this book as a revolutionary piece of literature. Spoiler alert: It's not. However, if you're the sort of person who enjoys reading well-written intelligent characters (think Death Note, Artemis Fowl, etc.) then you'll probably get a kick out of this. Ender is the quintessential put upon child prodigy and I think that, on some level, we can all relate to that.

The tension between Ender and Peter, presented coexisting as dichotomously opposed paradigms, was probably the best part for me.

Altogether, not a stunning book. The sci-fi elements really take a backseat to the psychological ones, which was probably for the best. I don't know whether or not I'll finish the series, and for now I feel pretty lukewarm about recommending this as high-quality fiction.

## Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World
- 2-stars
This was a bit painful to read. Not because, as you might suspect, it drew back the curtain and revealed a difficult-to-face reality of my distracted lifestyle, but because it spent a whole lot of time not doing that. The reason that this isn't rated one-star is because it's at least coherent and offers the occasional useful heuristic to the diligent reader.

Unfortunately, if you're anything like me - and I suspect that you are, if you're the sort of person who is given to pick up books titled such things as 'Deep Work' - you've already gotten the memo in broad strokes that distraction can be problematic when the goal is productivity. Is there anybody left out there who doesn't already know that Facebook, Twitter, e-mails and meetings thrive exclusively on a diet of your waking hours and shit condensed regret?

Well, listen. Even if it were just the fact that the book happened to be redundant for me, it's still not great. Cal Newport spends the majority of his time expounding on cherry-picked anecdotal examples which, after a while, begins to feel like an exercise in reinforcing his own preconceptions.

Anyway, the book isn't any great shakes. If you're the sort of person who is on the fence about trying a more monastic, abstemious or otherwise disciplined lifestyle, go ahead and pick it up. It will help if you happen to be the sort of impressionable nitwit who lacks solid reasoning skills. If this doesn't sound like you, start by saving your time and money - there are better thinkers, and better books.

I recommend Jaron Lanier for broad thinking on this subject, or Tim Ferriss for the more practically minded readers. Guide to the Good Life, by William B. Irvine might be better foundational reading in a general sense, and it covers similar ground.

## Tehanu (Earthsea Cycle, 4)
- 3-stars
This will be a seriously unpopular opinion, but this book - in my submission - marks the series having overstayed its welcome. The progressive political subtext, which had previously been emanating persuasive subtle undertones, now rears its ugly head and proceeds to glare doggedly at you, the reader, until you are finally forced to acknowledge it.

I do not have a problem with LeGuin's political views, nor that they manifest themselves in her work. However, I can't possibly be alone in feeling aggressed by fantasy novels in which those political views seem to transcend the fabric of the universe and take hold of the narrative.

That is how this book felt to me. If you want the political messaging in your fantasy novels subdued, this book will be somewhat the worse for you. That being said, I still enjoyed it well enough to finish, and it concluded in a more-or-less satisfying manner.

## Who Owns the Future?
- 4-stars
Jaron Lanier is brilliant, but if you're anything like me, you're going to have a mixed experience reading through this book. The author dances around a thought experiment, belaboring certain points that do not really warrant reinforcing, throughout the majority of the text. This left me with a definitely unresolved feeling, which may be the point. However, I'm not the sort of reader who takes much convincing when it comes to issues of, say, Social Media is centralizing wealth, etc. The mechanisms proposed, on their face, made immediate sense to me, which sort of rendered most of the book redundant-feeling.

Still, it's nice to spend some time in Jaron Lanier's thought space. It's cozy, and completely chaotic and feels just like being at home to me. If you enjoy him as a speaker, you'll enjoy reading this book.

## The Molecule of More: How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and Creativity—and Will Determine the Fate of the Human Race
- 4-stars
This book starts out stronger than it ends, and is peppered with stronger/weaker bits throughout. Sometimes the anecdotes and examples provided feel extremely poignant, and other times they feel totally unrelated.

If you're looking to broaden your understanding of how dopamine relates to your lived experience, this book will definitely serve its purpose. However, it's definitely got an axe to grind and gets a little preachy/prescriptive towards the end.

Altogether, I'd say if you've already bothered to search up a review that you're probably going to get enough value out of this book to go ahead and make the purchase. Just don't set your expectations too high - it's less scientific and a little less persuasive than I was hoping.

## Mort (Discworld, 4; Death, 1)
- 4-stars
Okay, it's hilarious and the universe is very satisfying. However, if you're anything like me, you'll occasionally find yourself trudging through one of Pratchett's long-winded tangents (designed to set up for the inevitable punchline) and asking yourself if it's really worth all the effort (it is). This book doesn't measure up to its predecessor, Equal Rites, partly - in my opinion - because its main character feels somewhat one-dimensional.

Still, read it for yourself and find out. If you've enjoyed the series so far, then there's little doubt that you'll walk away from this one dissatisfied.

## The Rise of Endymion (Hyperion Cantos, 4)
- 3-stars
This concludes the series with some well-written narrative twists, however - on the whole - it also reveals that the proverbial ball has been dropped. What you might've expected to be a complex narrative cleverly executed feels... well, a bit slapdash. It's not bad, but discerning readers will probably feel that, when the curtain is drawn back, the narrative will feel somewhat less robust than one might've anticipated, given the overall complexity of the universe.

Anyway, I would still recommend it for enjoyable prose and generally well-written characters, especially to Sci-Fi fans.

## Perfectly Legal: The Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit the Super Rich--and Cheat Everybody Else
- 3-stars
I have mixed feelings about this book. It's the sort of book I would recommend only selectively, and probably only to those for whom the book is liable to reaffirm an already strong opinion.

On the one hand, the author offers us a rare and sympathetic perspective on the inner workings of the IRS. He goes to great length to detail several egregious examples of tax fraud, and explains how the underlying systems are incentivizing such unscrupulous behavior. The book is remarkably free of partisan bias.

On the other hand, great swaths of the book felt like cruft. Astute readers will notice a lack of explanation for certain claims that seem to warrant supportive evidence. This might've been accomplished using space that could've been gained by snipping the paragraphs of descriptive prose the author heaps onto a topic that would've been better served dry. Instead, the author repeatedly asserts his artistic license, polluting an otherwise fascinating subject with vivid imagery that comes across as an attempt to manipulate the reader.

Taken altogether, I think it's a worthwhile read if you're willing to put up with a bit of authorial cruft. I wouldn't say it was enjoyable, but - by the end - at least it felt informative.

## Affiliation's Call: The Leyline War: Discord Rises
- 3-stars
The author has definitely gotten stronger since the first novel in this series.

Fans of classic fantasy fiction will find more than a few familiar elements to dig into: A colorful magic system; forces of chaos and order clashing on an epic scale; our protagonist, a good-hearted young man caught in the throes of his own adolescent transformation into adulthood. I felt that the narrative was spread a bit thin between both characters and events, but this book definitely serves to forward the plot and develop the world.

The story has well-executed elements of tragedy and heroism, and plenty of resonance with themes of political strife that translate well into the real world.

That being said, the book struggles to develop all of its characters sufficiently. While there are plenty of moments to pull at your heart strings, or bring you to the edge of your seat, there are also a few places where I was personally left wanting just a little bit more, as the narrative shifted to focus on a character, or an event, that I couldn't get properly interested in.

Overall, I'd say it was pretty good, and I'm interested to know what will happen in the sequel.

## Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos, 1)
- 5-stars
While the whole of The Cantos doesn't really leave the lasting impression of, say, Game of Thrones, the first installation - Hyperion is, perhaps, one of the most memorable, thrilling sci-fi novels in contemporary literature. Whether or not you go for reading through the entire series, I would heartily recommend this book to any fan of Simmons' work or sci-fi in general.

## The Light Fantastic (Discworld, 2; Rincewind, 2)
- 4-stars
Good. As with the previous Discworld novel, Pratchett's sense of humor carries his work. The gimmicks and his unswerving tendency to indulge in unnecessary figurative language is forgivable in light of his lovable knack for crafting quirky, charming characters that stick to the mind like glue.

If you enjoyed the first, you'll enjoy this.

## The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, 1)
- 5-stars
The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is probably the best fantasy-fiction novel I've read in my adult life.

Smooth prose meets exceptional story-telling, and wonderful world-building. Kvothe, the protagonist telling his own story, is so likeable, you'll find yourself grinning involuntarily as he regales you of his exploits.

The Dark Arts of Rationality is eerily close to being a real-world version of Patrick Rothfuss’s *Alar* that you can adopt *right now* to increase your power level and potentially make your life better. I’m tempted to believe he borrowed the whole concept from someplace similar.

## World Without End (Kingsbridge, 2)
- 5-stars
Ken Follett has a way of writing villainy that strikes a chord on the heartstrings of anyone who has ever entertained a dark thought of their own. It's the sort of experience that will keep you up at night, gazing into your own eyes through the mirror and wondering whose villain you are. Each character written with empathy, which introduces a level of sophistication that I've only very rarely found in fiction. Evil is something you only ever see from the outside; Ken Follett seamlessly flits between characters and, when you suddenly find yourself inside the mind of our antagonists, you discover that - in their own minds, at least - what looked like evil is justifiable misconduct.

This is the second book of his that I've read this year and, I'll admit it, he's now definitely ranked among my favorite authors.

## Tales from Earthsea (Earthsea Cycle, 5)
- 4-stars
While this book manages to flesh out the universe a little, it's not quite as satisfying as the main books from the series. Surely, if you're already enjoying the setting, you'll find some tidbits to enjoy, and there are some Easter eggs for careful readers - just don't set your expectations too high.

## The Farthest Shore (Earthsea Cycle, 3)
- 4-stars
This was my favorite of the Eathsea Cycle, which is really more a series of books about a fantasy world than a singular narrative. In my opinion, this book neatly encapsulates many of those themes and drives it home in a well-executed crescendo. If you have enjoyed the previous books, you'll probably love this one; the character development seems to come full circle here; it's very satisfying.


## A Wizard of Earthsea (Earthsea Cycle, 1)
- 4-stars
Classic fantasy set in a deeply realistic, believable universe. The prose are a bit rough around the edges, and sometimes dry or otherwise difficult to follow. I read this as a child and remember falling in love with it, so I picked it up as an adult to revisit it and was not disappointed.

## The Last Unicorn (The Last Unicorn, 1)
- 4-stars
Peter S. Beagle has a way of writing fantasy that, pardon the vague description, just feels very authentic. If you enjoy such classic fantasy as Brothers Grimm, or even perhaps Lovecraft, I suspect very much that you will enjoy this book. It is decadent fantasy for the classic connoisseur.

## The Color of Magic (Discworld, 1; Rincewind, 1)
- 4-stars
Gimmicky prose delivers on an excellent sense of humor, and a wonderful, whimsical fantasy world. At times, Pratchett's writing can be a little disorienting, but overall it's very worthwhile for a chance to follow the delicious, lovable characters and their zany adventures.

## The Golden Compass (His Dark Materials, 1)
- 5-stars
Lyra, our protagonist, feels believable in a way that most heroes don't - she's actually written like a child, rather than having been lazily granted wisdom beyond her years. She's full of tenacity, guile and gumption (all qualities that are played up in a positive light), but she's also naïve, reckless and gullible. Despite her heroic disposition, Lyra was a sheltered child. Watching her grapple with her own ignorance and sharing her sense of wonder/awe -- as she comes to terms with the sheer scope of what's taking shape -- feels truly epic as a reader.

This is a book that I read as a high schooler, more than a decade ago. It feels more manageable re-reading it now as an adult. It is grand nonetheless, and -- in my opinion -- stands the test of time admirably.

## The Slow Regard of Silent Things (The Kingkiller Chronicle, 2.5)
- 4-stars
An enjoyable tangent into the abstract mind of one of the minor characters from the main series. I'd say that, for me, it was equally enjoyable (especially how playful the author gets with his prose), but I don't think it's got the universal appeal that the main books offer.

## Lifespan: Why We Age—and Why We Don't Have To
- 4-stars
Well worth reading and recommending to others. I would offer the single caveat that David Sinclair, while brilliant in many respects, is not afraid to confidently endorse his less well-researched views. I will leave the reader to determine which those views may be.

## The Pillars of the Earth (Kingsbridge, 1)
- 5-stars
Ken Follett writes decadent prose and intricately weaves narrative threads together in such a way as to leave you always wanting more, but never dissatisfied. I felt personally attached to each character, even the ones that I loathed.

## The Fall of Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos, 2)
- 4-stars
A reasonably strong follow-up to the original knockout, Hyperion. A direct sequel with a twist.

## The Tombs of Atuan (Earthsea Cycle, 2)
- 4-stars
It's the equal of its predecessor, which is reasonably high praise.

## Endymion (Hyperion Cantos, 3)
- 4-stars
Some extremely lovable characters, and better-than-par world-building in Simmons' unique prose. I enjoyed the book, but the overall narrative is a but muddier than in its predecessors. At the risk of overstepping myself, I suspect that the author may have allowed the scope of these novels to get away from him.

## The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle, 2)
- 5-stars
A worthy sequel to Name of the Wind, which in itself says enough.

# No Contest: The Case Against Competition


Alfie Kohn spends the great majority of this book outlining a deleterious psychological state that he attributes wholly to competitive dynamics with structural roots deeply entrenched in our society. I wonder if this doesn’t go one level deeper, though. Isn’t competition just one route by which a person can arrive in this piteous state of affairs? I suggest that any pursuit of the identity via extrinsic means or externalization inevitably results in the same pathology, and that competition is simply one of many structural inducements to do so.

The symptoms seem – at least to me – indicative of a deeper problem regarding identity. While I appreciate the scathing critique of artificial scarcity, it seems to miss the point that making such comparisons is a useful psychological capacity, one simple feature of the pattern-seeking function of our brains, sorting the myriad feedback of the universe and assigning meaning. There can be no argument that a serious problem – along the lines of a pathology – emerges when we ascribe undue significance to any singular result of a contest, for example internalizing a positive result as a major feature of our personal narrative, or our identity. And OUR CULTURE DEFINITELY – STRUCTURALLY – SUPPORTS DOING THIS. The large number of individual exceptions (people who do not succumb to this pathology despite being immersed in a ‘competitive’ culture) suggests to me that this tendency has deeper origins. The tendency to take these externalities graft them onto our very souls is harmful, but from whence does the impetus to participate in this debasement come?

One recurring thought for me has been: What about the value of failure? Surely, we must all – at some point or other – make an attempt that does not result in success… has the appropriate application of the word failure become so loaded with negative connotations and personal indictment that we can no longer use it to describe this eventuality?

I think that one of the major issues is how we view failure. It is extremely common that participants in a given contest will be more-or-less left to their own devices when it comes to extracting value from a failed attempt. This is more true to the degree that the framework being discussed is traditionally, adversarially competitive in nature. I can’t help but think that this is a crying shame. We’ve set things up so that the status quo involves slapping a ‘loser’ label on failed attempts, especially in iconotypically contest-like settings and stopping there. This is, in my submission, a catastrophic structural failure. Since the structure does not invoke, encourage or entreat participants to have a growth mindset, it’s a situation where either you show up with the philosophical and personal tools to learn from your mistakes/failure or you’re likely to suffer potentially permanent damage to your self-esteem. BIG PROBLEM.

Competition, scarcity, and a zero-sum or binary sortation mechanism are not enough – in and of themselves – to produce the pernicious pathology to which Alfie Kohn’s entire book is a dedicated indictment…  **the missing ingredient is *stakes* (of a sort), by which I mean that for the whole thing to become pathological for the participant, the participant must believe that some essential integrity is in jeopardy, or at risk of substantial compromise/destruction** (the sort of thing you could interpret as harm, even if it’s not physical violence, for instance) – this is another way of saying ‘perceived as an existential threat’
