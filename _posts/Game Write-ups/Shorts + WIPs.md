# Battlerite

- Not Recommended

The game is great. Unfortunately, due to a massive design oversight, you spend about 50% of your time (not an exaggeration) waiting on countdowns, transition screens and queue times. Apparently the devs do not respect your time, so spend it elsewhere.  
  
[EDIT] 11/5/2022  
  
I just came back to this after... approximately three years(?) to discover that somebody (who I can only assume is the developer) left a comment on this review asking what they could do to impress me. In response to that, I should say that I think it would be sufficient if my earlier criticisms were addressed.  
  
I wasn't making some baseless claim. I spent a solid eight-hour play session with a stopwatch to confirm my suspicions and spent approximately 50% of my time waiting around with no ability whatsoever to control my character. If a traditional MOBA, such as DotA 2, had comparable downtime, you would be twiddling your thumbs for thirty minutes in between matches.  
  
It's worse than that, though, due to how short the matches are. Even if a traditional MOBA made you wait that long, you would still get meaty chunks of uninterrupted practice, which is what your average competitive player wants. Instead, in BattleRite, the experience was one of being constantly interrupted and itching to play again.  
  
While queue times are only quasi-controllable, the other stuff should've been prioritized as if it were a house fire you were trying to put out. Tweaking the queue logic to support a smaller demographic, under the assumption that players would rather be playing than winning, could've also made a difference.

# Clicker Heroes

- Not Recommended

Just another idle game, a quaintly re-skinned Cookie Clicker with a ‘mobile games’ aesthetic. Nothing to rave about, but what’s there is solid, if only within its genre. More satisfying than comparable titles simply due to the layers of abstraction it places between the player and ‘watching the grass grow’; it’s more ‘interactive’.

The devs know their audience; the interplay between heroes, ancients and active abilities w/ cooldowns provides latitude for mathematical analysis - active players will want to invest differently from passive ones, for instance.

Scrupulous readers will notice the abundance of ‘pay-to-win’ complaints; but pay to win what, exactly? There are no leaderboards at the time of this writing, so basically all you’re paying for is hastening the experience of whiling away your time. Nevertheless, the game still manages to feels somewhat solicitous, and maybe it does have something to do with the presence of a cash shop.

tl;dr: Cookie Clicker for RPG enthusiasts - a baby step in the right direction.

# Torchlight II

- Recommended

Torchlight II is the anemic afterimage of a lesser-known title: Fate  
  
Honestly, with its quirky pet system and cozy, streamlined dungeon crawling, it probably deserved more fanfare than it got. The UI leaves a lot to be desired; the game frequently suffers from poor conveyance, such as incomprehensible icons and locked chests that are only explained in the eventual sense once the player has mucked about a little on their own, or unintelligible jargon (thinking weapon nomenclature here), apparently chosen more for the sake of seeming unique than for any other reason.  
  
There's still plenty of good design to be found in Torchlight II, but it's mostly 'nice little touches, here and there', while the broader strokes work to produce a rather garish bigger picture. For instance, the visceral feedback is wonderful; the pillage-and-plunder cadence feels just right, with attacks and spells that slam into mobs and send them reeling with a satisfying oomph.  
  
All-in-all, I'd say there's more to appreciate about Torchlight II than there is to gripe about, but then again I'm a stickler for cohesion, and a holistic aesthetic. It would probably be a more popular game, were it not for Diablo III skimming off the top of its brawler-oriented fanbase and Path of Exile gnawing away at the ankles of its more hardcore audience, both of which seem to offer a more concentrated version of their particular brand of dungeon crawling. Torchlight II was a compromising, woefully over-ambitious middle grounder, and a bit ahead of its time in terms of open source reliance; don't expect too much from it.  
  
tl;dr: Torchlight II is a $20.00 experience, and with that in mind, go for it.

# Book of Yog

- Not Recommended

These games attract a certain kind of player, and some of those players are going to enjoy this game quite a lot. Given that, it almost feels unfair to write a negative review for this game. Unfortunately, there's just too much wrong with it for me to contribute to the deluge of thumbs ups.

Presumably, there's some real strategy and optimization that makes an appearance once you start allocating skill points and assembling a real lineup, but I didn't make it that far. The English translation is prohibitively terrible, as is the interface. It's got all of the nifty gacha mechanics that any world-weary gamer familiar with this genre will recognize, but they're poorly implemented and it feels like a real break from the core gameplay loop to engage with them.

Lastly, while I'm not docking points for aggressive fan service, it's worth mentioning here since the word aggressive almost doesn't cover it. If there were even a hint of satisfying gameplay hiding beneath the gigantic bazoongas, I wouldn't give it a second thought, but there isn't.

If you like this sort of game (and you're not just here for the aggressive anime-styled fan service), I recommend checking out Endless World, which delivers a very similar experience with fewer jarring breaks in the gameplay, better systems and a solid translation/interface.

# Unturned

- Not Recommended

The game looks, sounds and handles like hot garbage. It's a clunky, garish Minecraft that somehow manages to feel pointless even for a sandbox. You don't survive - you hunt, and the zombies are woefully unprepared to handle you, even unleveled. The vast majority of your experience will be roving between abandoned barns with only floating soap and looping crickets to keep you company.

The inclusion of certain features seems entirely senseless. For instance, why must I disable the safety on my gun? Why did the developer prioritize multiple passenger vehicles over other, arguably more important, features? Press 't' to examine the anatomy of your gun, but why? All I really need to know, to quote Arya Stark, is to "stick 'em with the pointy end" isn't it?

Apparently, slaughtering a wild pig yields more experience than downing a couple of mean greenies. Running and jumping will drain your stamina, but when it comes to swingin' around your katana you might as well be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terminator. The systems vary from inconsistent to incoherent; everything from the nonsense symbols at the bottom of your screen to the useless crafting and claustrophobic inventory makes for a poor experience.

tl;dr: More of a chore than a game, boring, frustrating and deeply flawed - needs an overhaul.

# Monster Sanctuary

- Recommended

This is a great game and I’m planning to revisit it someday to do the review justice. Until then, this is a placeholder.

# Song of Syx

Awaiting a real review…

# Siralim

- TBD

Bills itself as a successor to DWM, Pokemon and Monster Rancher, and claims to take inspiration from Diablo-esque ARPGs.
