So, it will come as a shock to a whopping _nobody at all_ that I'm a bit of an introvert. I like to read books, make art, play music and write very bad fiction. I watch the occasional television series _*cough* Game of Thrones *cough*_ and sometimes indulge in a bit of Twitch.TV to check up on [one of my favorite broadcasters](https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.twitch.tv/lara6683). It practically goes without saying that I spend _a lot_ of time by myself, and that's actually fine; solitude is an essential part of my process.  

Here's the thing about being alone. It can be great when you're expecting it, but sometimes it sneaks up on you. Sometimes you decide to take a nap smack in the middle of the day and when you wake up it's dark outside and none of your internet pals are responding. As a workaholic creative, this can be pretty stressful. If I'm especially unprepared, sudden isolation hits me like a sack of bricks. My anxiety levels shoot through the roof and my decision making flies right out the window. I get disoriented, fidgety and paralyzed.  

So yeah, this happened to me earlier today. I'm feeling better now. I guess I just wanted to share the experience. I apologize for the fact that this journal isn't especially uplifting. I don't even have any real advice for dealing with this sort of situation. Personally, I just try to stay level-headed and keep busy until it passes.  

Take care of yourselves,
