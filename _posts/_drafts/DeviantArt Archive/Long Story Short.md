This journal will, to some extent, include my thoughts on the topic of freelance art. In the spirit of full disclosure, I feel that I should open up by admitting that I never really made all that much money off freelance work. At the height of my involvement, I was making enough to pay for the single room I'd been renting and to feed myself. That was several years ago and, since then, I've only taken a handful of commissions; it amazes me that work still trickles in despite zero advertisement and years of virtual inactivity.  

The last time that I threw myself into art, I came out with a headache and mixed feeling about the industry as a whole. Things started out really well - to this day, I still seem to possess the same unquenchable thirst for improvement and limitless imagination that inspired many of my online peers. For a long time, I felt guilty about the people I must've let down when I stopped posting. When a medical condition laid me out for six months last year, I finally cut myself a break. Letting go of all that guilt gave me some breathing room to reflect a bit, so that's what I've been doing.  

I've been turning this over in my mind for a while, trying to figure out how to explain what happened without sounding like I'm making excuses. I think that, somewhere along the line, I attached an unhealthy importance to my nascent freelance career. Growing the business became my top priority, and my self-worth got all wrapped up in whether or not I was taking enough commissions to make a living. It seriously complicated my relationship to art; I couldn't just _draw anything_ and _upload it whenever_ anymore - I had my 'career' to consider.  

_Is this marketable? Will it sell?  
Does it fit in with my work?  
__Will it be popular?__Is it better than my last piece?__Am I uploading too frequently?__  
Should I be taking more client work?__  
Is this too controversial?  
__How will posting this personal work look to my clients?_ 

I could go on forever - just imagine all these thoughts buzzing around inside your head while you're trying to work. It's enough to drive you crazy; it's exhausting. At first, I could escape by drawing for myself with no intention of ever uploading my work, but eventually I started feeling guilty over how little I was uploading. I started avoiding social media.  

It took a long time to figure out where I'd gone wrong. It's taken even longer to stymie the unhealthy, compulsive thoughts that would creep up whenever I'd sit down to draw. I'm not very good at accepting personal shortcomings and I had to accept that I'm not really cut out to follow the same path that many successful artists have taken. My principle mistake was trying to attach importance to things that don't matter to me - like putting gasoline in a diesel engine.  

Fast forward to the present... I'm ready to throw myself back into art again and, hopefully, I won't make the same mistake this time. This is me declaring that I'm back, I'm alive and finally feeling well again. I'm here to kick ass and chew bubble gum, and I'm all outta gum.
