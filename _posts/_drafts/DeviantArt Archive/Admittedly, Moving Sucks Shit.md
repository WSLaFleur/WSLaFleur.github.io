In case you didn't catch that, I'm moving again. This time, all the way from the great state of California up to good old Missouri, where I'll be stationed somewhere top secret inside of Kansas City. Why? Well, for one, it's fucking expensive here (also, Kansas City has Google Fiber.)  

I'd like to say that I had fun, but honestly my last year pretty much sucked. I got a six month chunk of time bitten out of my life by a chronic illness. Oh well, shit happens - at least it's diagnosed now! There's also the fact that I haven't had my own bedroom since we moved here (LOL, incredible, I know). I really wasn't able to enjoy the wonderful California climate - it's gorgeous here, but I couldn't manage to get out much.  

Regardless of how the last year went, I'm pretty hopeful. My treatment seems to be working, so I've been feeling much better. Not only that, but we're moving into a rental home with enough bedrooms for everyone! I'll probably start posting work again - keep your fingers crossed.  

Also, I'm working on a game! Well, it's more like I'm working on a fork of an existing open-source game, but I'm still pretty excited about it. I'm not going to say anything more about that just yet, but keep an ear to the ground; I'll probably be posting development artwork eventually.  

Anyway, I don't want to ramble on forever about fucking nothing. I hope you guys are doing really well, and I'm super sorry that I haven't been around as much as I'd like to. I'll probably be visiting DeviantArt much more frequently in upcoming months. I know some of you guys are still out there, hopefully I'll catch you around!
