There are two short answers. The first is, 'a lot', and the second is, 'depends' — there's a lot of nuance surrounding this conversation; the question deserves a fair amount of thought. Too many artists are satisfied with the short answers.  If you're going to get serious about this, then you're going to need a healthy dose of brutal honesty to start with.  

According to Google, there are seven and a half billion people on planet Earth. That's enough people that, somewhere out there, an actual genius with all the genetic, biological advantages you can think of was born, conveniently, into circumstances where they could flourish in a field that suits their particular strengths. Actually, that's enough people to account for a few such individuals in every field of human endeavor, including art.  

Well, that's just great! Why am I even telling you this? Everybody just put down your pencils and go home; it's over. Since you'll never be able to compete with these super geniuses, all of your efforts are futile!  

Wrong. Try again!  

Everybody wants to be the best (like no one ever was), but, for many reasons, it's an impractical goal; for one, you can't measure your progress — there's no agreed upon measurement. For another thing, nobody starts out their artistic journey by thinking they've simply got to beat their neighbor. Don't misunderstand me — competition can be healthy, but beating out the competition isn't what makes you tick as an artist.  

All children draw, more-or-less, and they're difficult to satisfy. Children have vivid imaginations; they want to draw what they see in their heads. I think that's what we all want; to draw what we see in our heads. One of the major difficulties we face as artists is that, as we develop, we visualize complex mental images more clearly. As adults, the shortcomings of our work are more obvious; this is doubly true if you're a trained artist. Our tendency to focus on these shortcomings eats away at our motivation and enthusiasm.  

TO BE CONTINUED (whoops — I ran out of time to write this. I'll pick it up again next weekend!)
