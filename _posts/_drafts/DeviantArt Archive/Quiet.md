Silence breeds thought, and frankly, I find it terrifying. It seems like most of us do, since we tend to avoiding it. People don't want to face their thoughts; many of us are haunted by things we'd rather not think about.  

I've become an addict to my anesthetic habits; music, movies, video-games, etc. but that's not all, because since one thing alone can't keep me occupied, I resort to multi-tasking. I pile on the media 'til I'm drowning in white noise, all to avoid the pain of having to deal with my thoughts.  

Recently I turned it all off, just for a few minutes. I shut off my cell-phone and logged out of Skype, I closed out of Facebook and took off my headset, then I painted in utter silence. It didn't last long, eventually my thoughts caught up with me, but I got a glimpse of something; I shook loose some of the blockage in my head.
