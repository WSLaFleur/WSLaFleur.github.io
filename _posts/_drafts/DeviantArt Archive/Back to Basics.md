# Put frontmatter here

I have a tendency to grandstand, but I'll try to avoid that here. What I want is a small reminder to myself that this is serious. I'm generally optimistic; as in the glass is usually half-full from wherever I'm standing. It's the 'can do' attitude that's kept me going, despite naysayers, critics and an undeniable streak of self-loathing that exists somewhere underneath the surface of my type-a personality. It's also the source of self-compassion and generosity that allows me to forgive myself the daily missteps; I've been cutting myself too much slack, though.  

It's time to buckle down. I'm nearly thirty and I don't want to arrive at middle-aged without having pushed myself. I'm unsatisfied with my art. I'm craving progress. It's time to let the bat shit crazy little slave-driver out of his cage so he can rise up from the dungeon of my mind and take the control. It's time to be hard on myself again; to get off my high horse and crawl back into the trenches and work my ass off every day until I'm as good as I can be.  

Just to be clear, in-case you're reading this and getting worried about me - please don't. It's healthy to challenge yourself and that's all I'm doing here. Life's been hard on me these past few years and I acknowledge that; I lowered my expectations to maintain sanity during those tough times, but my circumstances have improved. If I'm going to take advantage of my situation, I need to allow my expectations for myself to grow.  

We can't be allowed to break too many promises to ourselves. Becoming acclimated to disappointment is dangerous. You should feel motivated to improve yourself. I've come dangerously close to letting contentment take over, but I'm going to claw my way back. This year I'm a beginner all over again. It's time to embrace the struggle.
