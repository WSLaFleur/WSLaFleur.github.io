I don't usually take time to plug projects that aren't my own, but this one's an exception. One of my best friends [Meirnon](https://www.deviantart.com/meirnon), who I met on DeviantArt years ago, before we both embarked on our separate art journeys, just had a game go live on Kickstarter. He worked on the pixel art, and his work is good - like, really good.

You can check out the project [**here**](https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/solarpoweredgames/highrisers?ref=card), or just do me a favor and drop him some love; this is a big step and I'm very proud of this guy.  

Congratulations, Arron!
