It's been a game-changing year for me. The lessons I've learned will stay with me forever.  

When I graduated high school there was no great feeling of triumph, I felt empty, like I'd spent four years not quite figuring anything out, but standing on the cusp of something much larger and just obscured from my vision. This year it feels like I'm actually graduating. Sure, I won't be wearing a gown, nobody will throw caps. I don't have to march in cadence, sheepishly down the aisle, all the while wondering "what am I really doing here?" This new year is something altogether different for me.  

This year I know what I'm up against and that it will determine a course for the rest of my life, but I feel prepared nonetheless. I've spent two years sharpening my weapons, polishing my tools, honing my skills; and now that I'm a contender, the next step is a battle to the top.  

The moral I've taken away from this year is as follows: If you're truly ambitious, life is your opponent - life will fight dirty, it will cheat, life doesn't care, it's brutal. My tendency was to fight and then - once I was ahead - to take a breather and wait for another round. I realize now, life is pitiless and the only victory is to pummel life itself to a limp, bleeding pulp. Take every advantage, fight harder when it falls. Be the master of your destiny, seize the upper-hand and never let up.
