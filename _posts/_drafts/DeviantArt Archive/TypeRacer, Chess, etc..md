Hey, so just in-case you weren't already aware, I am easily distracted. Check this out!

I spent the last couple of months correcting my slow typing speeds (45 WPM, hunt-and-peck typing) and, now, I average 105+ using a combination of TypingClub, TypeRacer and 10FastFingers; I learned to touch-type from the home row position using all ten fingers (well, I don't really use my left thumb). So, now, apparently I'm in the top 2% of typists online, but it still seems like everyone I know types way faster than me. I created a small series of typing prompts to help me build up my speed; if you're interested you can find them here.

Also, I've been getting back into DotA 2 and I'm currently pretty terrible (~ 1,900 MMR), but I stream it occasionally and some very kind Immortal players have been offering me solid advice for my climb. I really enjoy streaming, it's something I've always sorta been drawn to. Did you know I used to do video blogs way back in 2010 while I was living in Florida? Anyway if you're interested in DotA, feel free to stop by as I won't be streaming much else to that channel other than the occasional art stream.

Also recently received a bit of coaching for another game, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, by a close friend of mine who is among the best players of that game in the world. DCSS is a pretty cool Rogue-like game that's available to play through your web browser for free. If you're interested, I suggest checking out the aforementioned friend's content here.

In other gaming news, I just made an account over on lichess.org/, which is probably the best-designed website I've ever come across. I'm walking through the basics tutorials to brush up on my Chess skills and eventually I'll be doing a few daily matches to keep the brain fresh. I'm also playing the occasional bit of Tetris since I'm addicted to these little brain-teaser activities.

Outside of gaming/art, I've been doing daily musical training, including ear training and studying music theory. I'm using a combination of TonedEar, MusicTheoryNet and this nifty little pitch detector app to hum the notes I'm hearing and I've improved considerably! I'm also slowly trolling my way through a C++ course over at LearnCpp (part of the reason I wanted to increase my typing speeds was to make working with IDEs less cumbersome!)

All the while I've been trying to stay healthy and keep up the occasional drawing, but I've been failing. Until very recently I've sorta let my art slip, but I'm trying to do this MerMay challenge to build up my daily drawing habit again.

I realize that all of these hobbies probably makes me seem a bit manic, but honestly I'm feeling more satisfied than ever. I enjoy the natural oscillation that occurs while hopping between these disparate activities, it keeps my mind fresh. If I could build a lifestyle around indulging all of these hobbies, it would be a happy life.

A couple of things that didn't get mentioned because I haven't really started yet... I'd like to brush up on my math skills using KhanAcademy (I'm terrible at math and only really made it through Algebra in high school!) and learn a second language through DuoLingo (probably Dutch or Russian).

That's an update-and-a-half, huh? Some of you are probably wondering whether or not I'm still sick. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. Supposedly it's a chronic, incurable illness that could lie dormant for years, but right now I'm feeling a lot better and I'm ready to take advantage of it. I'm definitely in remission. I'll try to keep you guys posted, though.

Hey, leave comments. Doesn't have to be directly in response to this journal. Share what you've been getting up to lately. I read all of the comments, seriously. Typing out replies is also much easier now that I've increased my typing speeds.
