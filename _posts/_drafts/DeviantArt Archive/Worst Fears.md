A little while back,Â [I asked you about your fears](https://westlylafleur.deviantart.com/journal/poll/5895056/). Today I'm going to share mine. Here goes:  

I'm afraid that I will never accomplish anything. Or worse, that somewhere along the way I chose the wrong path. I'm afraid of my own ability to rationalize my choices after the fact, and that someday I will realize that I've been lying to myself. I'm afraid that I will die unsatisfied, having failed to live according to my own principles.  

I'm afraid that I'm a monster. When I was a child, I remember being cruel to animals. Today, I realize how a psychiatrist would've interpreted those behaviors. And even though I know that we all have fleeting thoughts of violence, I'm still afraid. Worse, I'm afraid that all of my self-discipline is a product of my own fear of myself.  

I'm afraid of being buried alive, or that I'll suffer some other highly unpleasant death; that my intestines will all fall out while I'm on the toilet; that I'll be crushed to death; that the undertow will suck me down beneath the waves and drown me; that I'll boil or freeze to death.  

I'm afraid that hard work 'paying off' is a myth, despite my convictions to the contrary. I'm secretly terrified that nobody else is struggling; that those who are more successful than me are simply better than I am, and don't have to try as hard; that by fighting, I'm just betraying how inferior I truly am. I'm afraid that I'm strapped in and that the ride is already in motion and that I'll never be able to switch tracks no matter how hard I rock the cart.  

I'm afraid that I can't help the people I care about because, sometimes, they're self-destructive or deluded. I'm afraid that by doubting them I've somehow failed to love them properly. I'm afraid that I lack some quintessential characteristic, without which I'll never be able to be a good friend, partner, son, etc.  

I'm afraid that I'll never find love. I'm especially afraid that, for some reason, it's because I'm not romantically compatible with the opposite sex. I'm afraid that someday I'll conclude it's not worth the headache or heartache and stop looking entirely.  

I'm afraid to believe anything anymore, and I'm suspicious of anyone who's sure they've got all their facts straight; knowledge is flimsy, and that frightens me. I'm afraid of complacency and politics. I'm afraid that all the skepticism in the world can't protect me from my own gullibility and that someday I'll wake up too late to find that I've sided with the wrong people.  

A special thanks to everyone brave enough to have contributed to that poll.
