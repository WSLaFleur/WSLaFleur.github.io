So, a lot of people have been shitting on DeviantArt lately...  

Let's just take a minute to acknowledge a website that's fostered an art-driven community _tens of millions strong_. DeviantArt eclipses it's nearest neighbors by an order of magnitude. It has been - and remains - the best online hub for sharing artwork and discovering artists; DeviantArt is thriving.  

DeviantArt is uniquely approachable, you don't have to be a professional; you don't have to be anything. We are the most inclusive art community that has ever existed, and while users may quibble with one another, DeviantArt itself remains admirably impartial.  

Despite its enormous popularity, DeviantArt is constantly being lambasted by commercial art blogs as inconsequential, juvenile and fetishistic. DeviantArt's notoriety inspires undue hesitation in fresh-faced artist that might be searching for a home on the web.  

It's time to grow up. The stigma is elitist and inaccurate; the majority of contemporary professionals are already on DeviantArt, and many artists such as [Jonas De Ro](https://jonasdero.deviantart.com/) & [Darek Zabrocki](https://daroz.deviantart.com/) openly admit to launching their careers through DeviantArt.  

DeviantArt provides artists a way to connect with their fans without the uncomfortable intimacy of a Facebook friendship. It provides a safe space for fan activity that would otherwise be considered illicit.  

It's not without its flaws - DeviantArt can sometimes seem like an unregulated mess, and Deviants are constantly toeing the line of what the website considers to be pornographic content. Personally, I think the responsibility is ours to do better as a community.  

DeviantArt is my second home; I met some of the best friends I've ever had though this website. If it weren't for DeviantArt I'd have never had a career in art; I might not have stuck with it, and I know it's not just me. We owe a lot to DeviantArt, so let's not lose sight of that.
