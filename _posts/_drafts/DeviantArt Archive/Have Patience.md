Slow down, breathe... listen.  

Remember that you're only human and, while it's true that human beings are capable of great things, progress takes time. Whether you're learning a new skill or honing the skills you've already got, it's going to take time. That project you're working on? It's going to get done one small, imperceptible step at a time. Stick with it.  

Take a moment to put yourself aside and really look at what you're doing. Resist the urge to run screaming to the nearest distraction and give yourself a fair shake - the way that you might consider your best friend's efforts if it were them instead of you. Diligence is an attractive quality, as is discipline; be reliable, be consistent. I know it's cliche, but _this_ is how you move mountains - one stone at a time.  

Don't despair. I know it's hard. Stick with it. It's not today, nor tomorrow, nor the next day or the one after, but someday you're going to look back at your cumulative efforts and they will tower over you like an effigy of the unstoppable nature of the human spirit. Keep going.
