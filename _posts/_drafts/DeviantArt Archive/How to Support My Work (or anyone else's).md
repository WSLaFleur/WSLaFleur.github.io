# Put frontmatter here

First of all, thanks. Unless you're here by accident, I appreciate that you were interested enough to find your way here. If you're here by accident, have a sip of water and take a deep breath - navigating the internet can be a bit tricky at times.  

Right out of the gate, let's address the elephant in the room - cash. If you want to see a creator flourish, throw money at them. You might be surprised by just how much a small amount of 'no strings attached' money can mean to a shoestring creator, living paycheck-to-paycheck out of a studio apartment and eating a steady diet of ramen noodles. I know it's cliche, but I've survived weeks of scanty fare, where five bucks could've made the difference between two and three meals a day (or put coffee in the cabinet!)

Let's say that you're like me, perpetually broke. Still, you'd like to show your support somehow. Thankfully, there's still a lot you can do to help out. Mostly, this involves sharing stuff with literally anybody else you think might like it. The vague notion of 'sharing' is deceptively weak-sounding, so I'm going to spend the rest of this journal breaking down different ways you can help out.  


1.  **Tag my content**, or **submit it to relevant groups**. You'd be surprised how much effort goes into thinking up relevant tags. Platforms like Instagram allow you to add a tag yourself, but don't be afraid to suggest one in a comment, note or direct message.
2.  Speaking of which, **leave a comment!** Not only does it actually mean a lot to me, even a simple compliment, but it actually helps to get my work seen (the system recognizes your comment as a form of engagement) by nudging it gently up the search results.
3.  **Favorite**, **Like**, leave a reaction, whatever. If you're talking about a Twitch streamer, go ahead and lurk by right-clicking the tab and muting the site if you're busy doing something else, but leave the tab open. 'Moral support viewership' can help to launch your favorite content creator out of the gutters of anonymity and into a career opportunity or, more likely, net them some desperately needed exposure.
4.  **Use my work!** Since throwing money at me isn't an option, go ahead and use my work. Display it on your desktop, wear it on your body; print it out and hang it on your wall, use it for your Dungeons & Dragons campaign. I don't care! You don't need to ask. Just keep following my work and share it with your friends.
5.  **Tell somebody about it!** Word of mouth is some powerful shit. You all know at least one fucker who wouldn't mind getting link-bombed to some sick dragon painting. Well, bomb away! It will take you approximately five seconds and you never know what might come of it, maybe they know somebody who wants to commission a tattoo (this has happened to me before!)
6.  **Share opportunities with me.** Don't assume that I already know anything, seriously - I'm just a gigantic dumbass that spends a lot of time drawing. Please, tell me about that convention where you think that I could sell prints like hotcakes, or that subreddit you frequent where my work would be a perfect fit.
7.  **Share my work!** It's one thing to learn about all the different places where my work might find a home, but keeping up with a couple dozen social media sites, groups and galleries is impossible (not to mention daunting for a recluse such as myself). Restrictive policies notwithstanding, go ahead and post my work anywhere you think it will be well-received. Self-promotion is generally frowned upon these days, so odds are that your post will do better than mine would've anyway.
8.  **Let me know what you want to see.** No guarantees, but go ahead and encourage more of what you like. "Dude, it would be so cool if you were to draw X!!!" or "I'd love to see [blank] in your style!!!" is the best way to make a request. I'm probably not going to draw your OC, but it's still flattering to know that you're interested in having me draw them. Also, you never know, artists get bored all the time.
9.  **Be a part of the community.** Join the Discord, visit the stream, respond to thought-provoking comments; just be a real person in general, please. Empty servers and silent channels are pretty unwelcoming; it just takes a few warm bodies to make the place cozy. Help to colonize my little corner of the internet.



This journal is probably going to be a work-in-progress. If you think of anything I ought to include, go ahead and let me know. I'll update in such a way as to notify watchers whenever I add anything major. Feel free to go ahead and ignore it if you don't give a damn.
