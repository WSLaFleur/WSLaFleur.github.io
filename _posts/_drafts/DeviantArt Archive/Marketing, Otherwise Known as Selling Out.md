[Marketing for Artists 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjw9vFuI2Qw&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deviantart.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title)

Commodify yourself, commodify your artwork, become a product and then sell that product. It works, and thinking like a business-minded shark helps. Entrepreneurial work is hard; being a content creator is risky and you can mitigate that risk by pandering to the status quo. Some people enjoy it, they find it satisfying to play to the whims of the crowd and derive a sense of self-worth through meeting an ostensible demand. I'm not one of those people.  

I do not advocate this approach, but it's a useful tool for those people to whom it comes naturally. Observing how it works can be a useful lesson in business management even if you don't plan on using it. Learning how to communicate _is_ important, and marketing your work _is_ important, but there's an undercurrent to this message and it's telling artists to tread lightly, not to offend anyone, to sacrifice your rough edges at the altar of internet fame.  

It's a seductive promise, but it doesn't work for me. The pressure to conform to the idea of palatable, viral content has been a constant source of mental duress for me over the years. Once you understand the concept of popularity via homogeneity, it's an inescapable, recurring thought that bears down on your every creative impulse. For me, it leads to a state of toxic schizophrenia where you're constantly trying to sheer up two modes of thinking that are inherently opposed, like struggling to hold two stubborn magnets together.  

I cannot balance the desire to express important ideas and tell magnificent stories with a pragmatic assessment of what _is_ and _is not_ in vogue. I have to drop one or the other, or I will _explode_. I've compromised before, searching for a sustainable rhythm, but the end result is always a hollow exchange that leaves me feeling dissatisfied.  



I don't think it's a black-and-white issue. Bohemian creativity isn't always good, and ruthless market engineering isn't always bad; nor are they good or evil, but a career in art can often feel like a struggle to maintain your creative integrity. It's not as simple as dollar signs.
