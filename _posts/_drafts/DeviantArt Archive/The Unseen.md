Hey guys, there's just a little thing I'd like to mention. A lot of you have asked me how long I've been drawing for, or how often I draw. The answer is pretty much non-stop for the past three and a half years. By saying that I'm always drawing, I mean that I'm drawing twelve-or-more hours every day.  

Most of what I draw just sits on my desk collecting dust. Occasionally I'll pick out something and upload it, but mostly I prefer to keep drawing. To put this into perspective, for every upload I probably fill out ten pages worth of sketches and hammer out a half dozen throwaway paintings, all of which remain unseen.  

The unseen work is important. It keeps me from feeling like I'm tap dancing a stage performance. It means there are always a lot of rough ideas to draw inspiration from whenever I'm feeling dry. Create enough 'unseen' work and inevitably you'll want to show some of it off.
