We ought to wake up every day glad to exist. To appreciate the sheer improbability of your existence, simply contrast those odds against something comparatively more tangible; for instance, the number of breaths taken during an average human lifetime. _672,768,000_ breaths - according to Google - is still an unimaginably huge number, so compare that with the number of seconds in a day: _86,400_ seconds in a day. Now, imagining eighty-six thousand of anything is pretty difficult, but if you were determined enough, you could probably count them all start to finish.   We are incomprehensibly tiny creatures. Our lives are spent amidst roiling oceans and thundering heavens, natural phenomena that occur within an invisibly thin layer of breathable atmosphere. Earthquakes threaten to swallow entire cities as the planet beneath us hurtles through space at terrifying speeds in its slingshot orbit around the sun. In distant galaxies, stars are exploding and collapsing to form black holes, and everything since the dawn of time is expanding outward at an ever-increasing rate, racing toward oblivion. Entropy beckons the heat death of the universe: the harbinger of the end.  

All this baffles the senses; our primate brains strain under the incomprehensible weight of sheer chaos. Temporary chemical imbalances produce a cocktail of emotions better suited to prehistoric times; we are programmed to feel anxiety, fear and anger. We are predisposed to be petty, craven opportunists.  

Now _breathe_. Go grab yourself a nice, hot cup of coffee or hot chocolate; a tall glass of milk, or a cup of tea. The universe is awesome, and you are alive. Against all odds, you get to exist.
