Hey guys, I'm here typing out a journal 'from the couch' because, unfortunately, everything is fucked again — my health issues have resurfaced. Fortunately, this time, something is being done about it. I got my insurance sorted out and I've been to my primary care doctor who, after a brief examination, came to the brilliant conclusion that I ought to be referred to a specialist (in my case, a gastroenterologist) — so here I am, waiting for my appointment on the 7th during which, with any luck, I will be scheduled for the tests required to diagnose me.

I'm sorry that I didn't write sooner - this flare up came out of nowhere and, ever since, I've been adjusting to life oscillating between pain and restless sleep. Initially, I didn't think I'd be out of commission this long. It's been a month and I'm still pretty bad (albeit marginally better than during the worst of it). They gave me pain meds, but the side-effects include some of the worst constipation I've ever experienced (its own, special brand of discomfort, obviously).

Luckily, I'll be getting medical attention soon. The worst part is that I was just starting to make real progress re-integrating into my online communities. You know, getting back in-touch with friends, making some new acquaintances and generally having a good time keeping busy on the internet. I've discovered that long periods of time where, for whatever reason, I'm unable to share stuff with other people affect my mood pretty badly; I suppose, psychologically, it's simply the effect of being isolated from the larger community.

I'm set up with a Chromebook now. So, whenever I'm feeling up to it, I'll be able to write and lurk in your Twitch channels, shitpost to Discord, etc. Good luck with stuff, and feel free to share in the comments, I'll definitely have time to read them!
