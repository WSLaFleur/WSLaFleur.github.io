It's Sunday again, and so I shall endeavor to shake loose some thoughts from my cobwebbed mind to share with you. Last week, I started out with the intention of exploring some relatively actionable, if not prescriptive, thought space and got completely derailed. Let's see what happens this week.  

My interest in the subject of self-improvement extends well beyond my craft. I'm fascinated by the human capacity to grow, adapt, learn and self-direct. In my experience, most people (especially in creative fields) have a tendency to focus on their own limitations and shortcomings. However, there are a few people who, whether by deliberation or coincidence, have a tendency instead to focus on their own potential; the difference is both subtle and tremendous.  

Think of somebody, matching that description, that you've met; somebody with a focus on their own potential. Have you got it? If so, what are their characteristics? Can you think of more than one such person and, if so, do they have anything in common?

I'm going to cut this journal very short because, I've just realized, I actually want to hear your answers to those questions. Probably it will shape the next journal I write on this subject. I'm very interested, so feel free to share your thoughts (I do not mind wall-of-texts.)
