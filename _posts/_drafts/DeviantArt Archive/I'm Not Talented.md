Please, don't say that I'm talented; I know that you mean well, but after these past couple of years I'd just rather not hear it. Don't get me wrong - it's not that I don't believe in talent, I just don't exemplify it.  

For clarity's sake: I am a self-taught artist, but my abilities did not gush forth from some divine wellspring; as a matter of fact you would be demonstrably wrong to say that I was ever a natural. I am the farthest thing from a gifted artist.  

My learning curve may seem tremendous to outsiders looking in, but my strategies for improvement involve isolation, caffeine-addiction, insomnia and an injurious practice regimen. It's taken me two years of sleep-deprivation and black coffee to produce even one painting I'd consider portfolio worthy.  

So please don't take my work for granted with cavalier terms like _talent_ and _inspiration_; I don't have the luxury of waiting around for inspiration and have often had to work around my own deficits.  

In the immortal words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow... _"The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight, but they, while their companions slept, were toiling upward in the night."_
