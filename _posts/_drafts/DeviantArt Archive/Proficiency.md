Practice can be frustrating, mundane and agonizingly repetitive, but it _is_ necessary. I think, rather than being vital to improving the quality of your work, the importance of practice is that it makes us _proficient_, this is a crucial distinction.  

Without practice you'll slave for hours or days over a mediocre piece; we've all been there. Consider the alternative, rather than pouring your soul into the next humdrum scribble, do yourself a favor and commit those hours to practicing fundamentals instead.  

Nobody is invincible, and you _will_ despair if you continually subject yourself to failure, but practice isn't showcased; nobody's watching. You can fail _endlessly_ and that's actually the point; if you had no shortcomings, there'd be no reason to practice. Adopting this perspective is half the battle.  

Make sure to _be reasonable_, measure your progress in months, not weeks. Exercise your patience, practice discipline.
