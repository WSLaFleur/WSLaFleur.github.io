This is a journal I'm writing to myself.

Draw every day; nothing works like practice, and relax, setbacks are temporary and anxiety smothers genius. Entertain your curiosity, but don't let it run a muck.

Use music to your advantage, don't let it muffle your thoughts. Nearly everyone enjoys music; wake up to something, but turn it down when you need to think. Explore new music; share and be receptive in this.

Get lost in your work, don't dawdle; be economical.

Respect anyone willing to support your work; listen to what they say. Take time to appreciate flattery, but don't revel in it. Heed insults; DON'T respond to them. Receive every criticism, but don't let them discourage you.

Make as many friends as you can; don't let them take advantage of you. DON'T take advantage of them.

Have heroes, but not idols. Approach them and don't waste your time on anyone who treats you badly. Be modest, but not necessarily humble.

Take time to examine your achievements. Aim to surpass them.

Observe the world around you, take notes; art is synthesis and expression. Breathe.

Advice is cheap and wisdom scarce, but once you're sure of something, share it.
