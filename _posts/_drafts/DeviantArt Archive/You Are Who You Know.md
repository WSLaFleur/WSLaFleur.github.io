Here's one I've never quite gotten the hang of, but always intuitively known to be true on some level. The cliche goes something like "You are the average of your five closest friends", but that's not the whole story.Â [It goes much deeper than that](https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://medium.com/the-mission/youre-not-the-average-of-the-five-people-you-surround-yourself-with-f21b817f6e69), you're influenced by the company you choose to keep. Your social climate affects your perception of the world, what you perceive to be norms and thus what you expect from yourself and other people.  

Honestly, I've never been very good at pruning fruitless relationships myself. The contacts of people who've mistreated me tend to linger around in my phone for much longer than they ought to. Even when I'm well aware that their impact on my life is either negative or that they're simply cluttering up my social life.  

I'm finally waking up to this fact: Your social climate is like a garden. It's like a garden that surrounds your home - it affects you; it requires maintenance. You want to have a healthy relationship with it. You need to enjoy the routine act of maintaining your friendships. Correspondences should never leave you feeling drained. Cultivate a thriving, healthy relationship with others; pull up weeds and trim dead branches, all of that good stuff.  

Metaphor aside, I'm going to spend more time looking my day-to-day interactions with others. I want to cultivate frequent, positive interactions that feel meaningful. If you think about it, you can probably identify four-or-five people with whom you only associate positive thoughts - strengthen those relationships (that doesn't mean drown them in correspondences, lol). Inversely, you can probably think of a few people who've left you hanging or frequently make you feel like crap; those are the weeds.  

I don't know if this will help anybody, but I really benefit from writing down my thoughts like this. Please don't think that I'm trying to be some sort of self-help guru, I don't think of myself or my writing that way. I'm just a dude who's trying to figure it out like everybody else.  

Good luck and let me know if you've got any advice or whatever in the comments. Share stories if you've got something that relates to this journal. Thanks for reading!
