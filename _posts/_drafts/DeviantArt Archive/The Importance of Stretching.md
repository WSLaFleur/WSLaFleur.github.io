I just want to remind all of you to get up and stretch your legs. Seriously, do it now. Don't even finish this paragraph. What are you waiting for? Go, shoo! Just move around in your human body for five minutes; loosen up - shake out the stiffness in your wrists and ankles.

Do you remember way back in high school? Okay, so maybe you're not old like me, but hear me out. There's a ton of downtime in high school; during recess and waiting around in line at lunch and during homeroom and going through hallways between classes. I used to move a lot during school and now I don't move hardly ever. Everything that I've got to get done happens at my PC, so I've suddenly found myself in the awkward position of trying to fit some movement back into my life.

I have a standing desk, and I try to take frequent walks. I stretch in the morning and afternoon, but it's probably not enough. The movement happens in-between long stretches of stillness where I'm focused on whatever I'm currently doing. The more that I move, the less achy and stiff I feel - which I've discovered is pretty damn important to staying productive.

I just wanted to share a quick, random thoughts journal with you guys. I hope you're doing well and that this journal finds you in good health.
