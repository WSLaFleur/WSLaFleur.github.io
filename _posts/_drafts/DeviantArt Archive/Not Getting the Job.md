Here's how getting hired works...  
  
- Read the job description...  
- Submit your portfolio, or _don't_...  
- Get hired, or _don't_...  
  
I recently made a post about bad clients, this is the other side of that coin. Submitting your portfolio is like handing over a resume, which turns out to be a lot like prostitution; it's quick, dirty and impersonal; the whole process might last only thirty seconds and _don't_ expect them to call.  

If (and this is a big _if_) they _do_ decide to let you know they're _not_ interested, be thankful; they didn't have to. Whatever you do, _don't_ throw a tantrum. Even if they let you down hard, just save yourself the embarrassment and show some dignity.  

So remember, don't be that kid; the one who's convinced of his own superiority _even though_ he's consistently picked last. Be modest, be realistic; you'd be surprised how far it goes.
